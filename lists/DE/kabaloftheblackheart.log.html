<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnar√∂k Dark Eldar, Kabal of the Black Heart list is based on the Epic UK version of the list. There are no major differences, but a number of smaller changes have been made.
</p>
<p>
    The 'Fleet of Foot' special army rule now also grants Dark Eldar formations a +1 bonus when attempting a March action, to further encourage the use of this unique aspect of the army.
</p>
<p>
    The Syndicate core formation is more expensive, and has a compulsory Dracon character. This is because it felt a bit too obvious in the list, at the expense of the list's Partisan formations, which have generally been made slightly better over all.
</p>
<p>
    The Vessel of Pain has slightly different stats, again because it seemed a bit too powerful compared to its points.
</p>
<p>
    To make the lack of AA in the list less extreme, Ravagers and the Barge of Pleasure now has a 30cm AA6+ attack.
</p>
<p>
    The Executioner Landing Module is significantly cheaper, but with different stats. In a list with a compulsory BTS, its cost was a bit too much to motivate actually taking.
</p>
<p>
    The Partisan section of the list have many formations with very similar functions. Some minor tweaks have been made to differentiate between these, giving clearer strenghts and weaknesses. The Wych Cult for example has 1+ Initiative Rating, while the Talos Swarm gained the Infiltrators special rule.
</p>
