Once all of the shields have been knocked down, the Titan may be damaged normally and you may make saving throws against any hits that are scored. Hits from close combat ignore void shields but units using their firefight values must first knock down any shields before they can damage the Titan.",

In addition, if a Titan regroups it can use the dice roll to either repair the void shield or remove Blast markers (e.g., if you rolled a 2 you could repair 2 shields, remove 2 Blast markers or repair 1 shield and remove 1 Blast marker)."
