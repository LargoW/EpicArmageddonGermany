  "usage": [
    "v1.0.0: This list is based on the E-UK version, but with a number of changes to balance the choices in the list, and reduce the potential for spamming Mission / Exorcist formations. The overall structure is a lot more rigid, the Act of Faith rule has been changed to make it more thematic, and reinforce the list's aggressive playstyle, and it is possible to take more Inquisitorial support formations, which is intended to make it possible to play the list more like a Ordo Hereticus army.",
    "Some other major changes: The basic Battle Sisters unit now has a Heavy Bolter instead of the Heavy Flamer, while the Exorcist has had its stats changed to make it more of a support formation instead of a main battle tank. It is also possible to take them in their 'Whirlwind' configuration. Most infantry unit types have their own dedicated formations, instead of being spread out across the army. This makes each formation a bit more unique, but also makes it easier to remember what each type of 'sister' does, which can be quite confusing for an opponent. The 'Emperor's Chapel' unit has been added to give the army a thematically appropriate WE unit and the Mission formations a bit more staying power. The Exorcists are also easier to integrate into these formations. The Repressor and the Immolator has been made a bit more attractive compared to the basic Rhino, which is no longer free. The Lightning Strike Fighter has been given slightly different stats."
