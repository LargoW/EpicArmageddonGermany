<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Snakebite Clan Ork list is the EA:Ragnarök version of a Feral Ork list. We felt the existing Feral
    Orks lists were a bit one-sided and frustrating to play against, with an overload of large 4+ reinforced armor War
    Engines. We have done major changes compared to the Feral Ork list, while trying to keep the army theme intact and
    your existing models relevant.

<p>
    The Ork infantry has been changed for the Snakebite list into primitive versions of their more advanced brothers,
    with less advanced weaponry. The new transport has been introduced, the Gargantuan Squiggoth which is in between the
    Squiggoth and the Orkeosaurus in size. The Orkeosaurus has received a significant reduction to its armor, but is now
    faster. A maximum of two Steam Gargans can be taken per formation, and the critical hit effect has been changed, but
    you can now have multiple formations of Steam Gargants in your army. A few new units has been introduced to give the
    list access to some shooting, like the Lobbas and the Squiggoth Supa-Lobba.
