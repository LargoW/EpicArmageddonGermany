  "intro": "Unlike the very rigid formations used by the Imperium, Ork formations vary widely in both size and composition. The rules for creating Ork formations reflect this. The most common type of Ork formation is the warband. Other more specialised formations do exist, such as Kults of Speed and Blitz Brigades. The different types of Ork formations you may choose are shown on the army list that follows.</p><p>Some Ork formations come in different sizes: Normal, Big & 'Uge. A Big formation is double in size and a 'Uge formation is triple. If there is a limitation to formation upgrades, then the limit is doubled for a big formation and tripled for a ’uge formation. For example, a normal sized Kult of Speed can include 0–1 Oddboy, a big Kult of Speed can include 0–2, and a 'Uge Kult of Speed can include 0–3.",
