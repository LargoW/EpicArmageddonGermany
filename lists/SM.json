Halve the number of extra hits suffered by a Space Marine formation that loses an assault, rounding down in favour of the Space Marines.",

Then any troops carried in the drop pod must disembark within 5cm of the drop pod or within 5cm of another unit from the same formation that has already landed, so long as all units are placed within 15cm of the drop pod. Drop pod models should be removed from the board once the formation they transport has disembarked."
