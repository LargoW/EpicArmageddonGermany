      "EA-R Emperor's Children is based on the NetEA version of the list. Apart from all the changes inherited from Black Legion list, there are a few significant differences. It is no longer possible to play the list without Noise Marines, but it is also not possible to play a purely fearless list. The list gets a Greater Daemon Pool point for free, to compensate for the loss of flexibility that the Black Legion has. Emperor's Children Terminators (Sirenshriek Terminators) are now fearless, mostly for thematic reasons. The Questor and the Subjugator have slightly different loadouts that are closer to the fluff, while the Knight formations are no longer 0-1 but are much smaller. The Hell-Knights have slightly better stats to bring them in line with the Hell-Scourges. The 'Debaser' Defiler has been introduced from the E-UK list. The Chaos Thunderhawk costs 25 points more, like in Codex Astartes."
