<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnar√∂k Thousand Sons list is based on the E-UK version.
</p>
<p>
    Mixed Retinues: While Rubric Marines (with 3+ Armour) now easier to get rid of, making formations mixed between non-fearless and fearless units makes the retinues more flexible but also more brittle. Thousand Sons retinues are extremely expensive, but has access to what are probably the best selection of daemons and are very hard to shift. The Thousand Sons Marines are now ordinary Chaos Space Marines but with Tzeentchian weaponry.
</p>
<p>
    Terminators and Teleport Homer: While Thousand Sons do not have access to Dreadclaws, they do have the 'Teleport Homer' special rule, making up for their Terminators lack of competence in CC.
</p>
<p>
    Daemons: The Daemons are basically the same as in the E-UK list, but with the addition of the Horrors inherited from the Black Legion list.
</p>
<p>
    Daemonic Knights: These formations are no longer 0-1, but are on the other hand fixed in formation size which makes it impossible to create the death star, BTS formations of Daemonic Knights that were both possible and very useful in the NetEA version. The stats of the Hell-Knight has been boosted to bring it to par with the Hell-Scourges. These are also no longer War Engines, but are intead of the new unit type H-AV, which are intended to represent all 'Knight-class' units (see the 'Rules' section of the website for more details). The Hell-Strider has slightly different stats.

<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>
<ul>
    <li>The Debaser, a faction specific Defiler, is introduced, based on the E-UK stats.</li>
    <li>The Questor and Subjugators have slightly different weaponry, bringing them more in line with the fluff, and have had their speed reduced by 5cm in line with other Warhound type units. The Subjugators are now in parity with the Questors in both capability and cost.</li>
</ul>
