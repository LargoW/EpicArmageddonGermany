<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnar√∂k Death Guard has taken some inspiration from the E-UK version of the list, as well as the Emperor's Children Net-EA list. Instead of the Invulnerable Save and lack of access to the 'March' action, the list trades increased save for worse speed on some of its units, making the list slower overall. Most changes and concepts have been inherited from the Black Legion and the Emperor's Children lists, in particular the mixed formations of Plague Marines and Chaos Space Marines.
