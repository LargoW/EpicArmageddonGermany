<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnar√∂k World Eaters list is based on the E-UK and the NetEA versions, but has no access to Titans, instead orienting it towards the great selection of Khorne Daemon engines that exists in 40k. It inherits the changes made to the Black Legion list.
</p>
<p>
    Split Retinues: In the E-UK version of the list, the basic retinue could be very powerful if many formations were taken, as Khorne Berzerkers were comparatively cheap for their size, and very hard to get rid of since the entire formation was fearless. The introduction Chaos Assault Marines retains the very aggressive playstyle of these formations while making them more vulnerable to losing Engages and giving retinues some shooting.
</p>
<p>
    Juggernauts: With better armour, better speed but no infiltrate, these formations must now get closer to the enemy than before. The introduction of Bloodcrushers gives the list access to exceptionally hard Daemons that can keep pace with other Juggernauts.
