<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnar√∂k Raven Guard list is based on the NetEA version, but with major changes to many of the units.
    Sternguard Veterans are no longer <i>Scout</i>s and has been redesigned into a firefight specialist unit, with <i>Sniper</i>
    firefight. The Land Speeder Tempest no longer has anti-air capabilities, but instead has a decent anti-tank weapon.
    The Storm Eagle is more expensive but now has 2DC. Both Sternguard and Vanguard formations has been given the
    Eldar-inspired ability to move full speed during consolidation moves to represent the Raven Guard ability of moving
    behind enemy lines with unrivalled stealth.

    The guerrilla style warfare of the Raven Guard chapter is reflected by the small infantry based formations and the
    unique special rules given to Raven Guard Scouts and the elite Sternguard and Vanguard formations. The list also
    lost access to most armoured vehicles available to Codex Astartes, and has to rely on Land Speeders, Devastators and
    Warhounds for firepower.

    The small but deadly formations of the Raven Guard can be used to great effect when controlling the flow of the
    battle. But when taking casualties they can quickly be reduced to a point where they can not threaten even the
    weakest enemy formations. Make sure you have a plan for how to deal with large enemy formations, and consider adding
    an upgrade here and there to boost formation sizes.
