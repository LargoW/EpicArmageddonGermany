<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnar√∂k Codex Astartes list is based on the NetEA version. A great challenge with Codex Astartes is to keep
    it relevant while adding new Space Marine chapters, where each new chapter will do a better job at a particular
    playstyle. To make it unique, it was decided to keep the wide-open structure of the original list, while making
    other Space Marine lists more rigid. It is also one of the few lists that has access to the very powerful Landing
    Craft. A Space Marine fighter, the Storm Talon, has been introduced for all Space Marine lists, but as a unique
    feature of the Codex Astartes the Imperial Aircrafts has been kept in the list. The option to include a Warlord
    titan has been removed from all Space Marine lists
</p>
<p>
    A major change to all Space Marine lists, in order to see more characters in the lists, is that the 'They Shall
    Know No Fear' rule has been amended so that characters with the <i>Leader</i> special rule no longer removes
    additional blast markers. This allowed us to lower the cost for various Space Marine characters. Captains,
    Librarians (along with some other nerfs) and Supreme Commanders have been made 25 points cheaper across all relevant
    lists. At the same time the availability of the 'Commander' upgrade has been limited to formations considered core
    or elite, rather than support formations, across all Space Marine lists.
</p>
<p>
    A new anti-air unit has been introduced in all Space Marine lists: the Stalker. The Stalker is cheaper than the
    Hunter, but has shorter range on its anti-air gun.
</p>
<p>
    A major source of power in all imperial lists has always been the Warhound titan. In an attempt to bring the power
    level of the Warhound down to par with it's price we have reduced the speed of the Warhound to 25cm and its
    firefight value to 5+. In an attempt to see more Warounds used in pairs, rather than singles, we increased the
    discount by another 25 points when buying Warhound pairs.
</p>

<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>
