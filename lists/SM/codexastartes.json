      "v1.0.0: The EA-R Codex Astartes list is based on the NetEA version. A great challenge with Codex Astartes is to keep it relevant while adding new Space Marine chapters, where each of will do a better job at a particular playstyle. To make it unique, it was decided to keep the wide-open structure of the original list, while making other Space Marine lists more rigid. It is also one of the few lists that has access to the very powerful Landing Craft. The Warlord was dropped, and the Thunderhawk was increased by 25 points, but the Imperial Aircraft has been retained, and the Storm Talon introduced as well. Warhounds can only be bought in pairs, but may be split up with the 'Independent' special rule.",
      "Other major changes: The list now has access to the Stalker AA unit. Dreadnoughts are cheaper when bought in pairs. The 'Sniper' upgrade is cheaper. Assaults are 25 points cheaper. The Predator Destructor has recieved an additional shot on its main gun, bringing it to parity with the Annihilator. The seldom seen Land Raiders can now be taken in formations of three, and is also cheaper to take as a transport option.",
      "The Battle Barge has had its Slow and Steady rule replaced with 'Slow to Arrive' (can be plotted from turn 2 onwards instead of turn 3 onwards) and is also significantly cheaper.",
      "Last but not least, the ATSKNF rule has been amended so that Leaders with this rule only remove one extra Blast Marker instead of two, and Captains, Librarians and Supreme Commanders have been made 25 points cheaper across all relevant lists."
