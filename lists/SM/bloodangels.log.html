    The EA:Ragnar√∂k Blood Angels list is inspired by the NetEA and EpicUK lists. The list is focused on engages while
    sacrificing long range shooting. It has a number of unique units and formations, including the iconic Death Company
    and Sanguinary Guards. The Blood Angels chapter also has access to the Storm Raven air transport, which has the
    ability to transport Dreadnoughts. The Storm Ravens opens up for some unique and powerful air-assault options, or
    the option to pick up large formations including Dreadnoughts deployed via Drop Pods.

    The Blood Angels list is well suited to an aggressive play-style with a mix of fast ground-based formations, space
    and air insertions.
