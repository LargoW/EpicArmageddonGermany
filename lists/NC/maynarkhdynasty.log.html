<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnar√∂k Maynarkh Dynasty Necron list has undergone major changes compared to the NetEA and Epic UK lists. We
    felt that the Necron list played too differently from all other Epic armies, and were breaking some of the most
    basic rules for how armies behave in Epic. This is our attempt at bringing the Necron army closer to how other
    armies work, while still keeping the unique way Necron works with their teleporting portals.

<p>
    Most importantly we made all portals <i>enduring</i>, meaning that they do not phase out when broken. They are also
    <i>ponderous</i> meaning that they may only make a single withdrawal move instead of two when becoming broken or
    failing to rally. Formations using a broken portal will also receive a blast marker. These changes combined makes
    the portals more predictable. The Necron player still has great flexibility when deploying his portals, but has to
    think harder on where he wants them, as they are slow to reposition. When playing against the Necrons you now have
    better control and chance to react as you, after the initial teleport, know roughly where the portals will operate.
    And hopefully you will no longer end up in a wierd situation where you rather not break the opponents portals as
    this will most likely cause them to reposition next turn. This also gives the Necron player a choice weather to
    teleport all portals in turn one or so save a formation or two for later...

    The basic Necron rules has also been changed. The regeneration/reanimation has been replaces by a 5+ invulnerable
    save to represent the Necrons abilities to repair themselves. We felt this simplifies gameplay as dead units will
    always remain dead. Most Necron units also received the <i>Machine Spirit</i> and <i>Expendable</i> special rules
    meaning that formations that lost their Lord will be significantly weaker.
