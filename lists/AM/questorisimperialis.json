  "v1.0.0: The Questoris Imperialis list is a mix of the E-UK and NetEA Knight lists, with stats and structure taken from both. As these lists are based on the retro-40k 1990s fluff, most Knights have had their names changed to prevent naming conflicts with the Knights in the current fluff.",
  "The biggest change from the E-UK and the NetEA Knights is obviously the fact that Knights no longer are DC2 WE, but are H-AV instead. This change makes Knight formations a lot more sane to play with/against, and makes it a lot easier to stay within the EA rules. It also means that sniping the Baron with a Pin-Point is no longer an issue.",
  "Another significant change is that the Retainer formations are more accessible, making the list a bit more flexible."
