Transported Gun Drone formations may be split across multiple Tiger Sharks as an exception to the normal aircraft transport rules. The Tiger Sharks cannot land, make an engagement, or embark units, but can disembark transported Gun Drones after an approach move. The Gun Drone formation may shoot when it disembarks as normal (see Transporting Ground Units), and counts as having activated for that turn. After this initial deployment the Gun Drones are a completely independent formation."
