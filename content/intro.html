<h2>Epic Armageddon: Ragnarok</h2>

<p>
    Welcome to the Fan Based website for EA-Ragnarok. On these pages you will find fan based lists and scenarios
    developed by the
    EA-Ragnarok team. A lot of list foundations and ideas are credit to the NetEA group, Epic-UK group and the F-ERC
    group. We have done these list because we really enjoy the game and list development.
</p>

<p>
    These list are still in Development and some may not be ready for a balanced game. We have marked lists where we
    feel they are at within the development for ease of creating a fun game. We also invite you to comment/bring ideas
    to the table through our Discord channel (link on the 'Online Gaming' page) we have set up. With epic being out of
    production for many years now, our gaming friends are far and wide for us. We play alot of games online and invite
    you to also join in on games through the discord channel. We will be setting up a online gaming page with tutorials
    and links to play games via Table Top Simulator. This software is availible on steam for a few dollars.
</p>

<p>
    We hope we have created a fresh new vibe on the game and we aim for some fun gaming sessions.
