<h2>Epic Armageddon: Ragnarök</h2>

<p class="lead">
    Welcome to Epic Armageddon: Ragnarök. On these pages you will find fan based lists and scenarios for Epic Armageddon
    developed by the EA:Ragnarök team. A lot of list foundations and ideas are credit to the NetEA group, Epic-UK group
    and the F-ERC group. We have done these list because we really enjoy the game and list development. We hope we have
    created a fresh new vibe on the game and we aim for some fun gaming sessions.
</p>

<p>
    These list are still in development but we feel we have reached a point where they are ready for a public beta.
    We invite you to comment/bring ideas to the table through our Discord channel (link on the 'Online Gaming' page) we
    have set up. With epic being out of production for many years now, our gaming friends are far and wide for us. We
    play a lot of games online and invite you to also join in online games through the discord channel. On the 'Online
    Gaming' page you will find tutorials and links to play games via Tabletop Simulator. This software is available on
    steam for a few dollars. Special thanks to 'Norto' for a ton of the initial work on this project.

<h3>List Design</h3>
<p>
    We have done a few general changes across all Epic Armageddon: Ragnarök lists that we hope will
    improve the game, and overall list design.
</p>

<h4>Titans</h4>
<p>
    We wanted Titans to be a more common site in Epic. Looking at NetEA and Epic UK we thought there were a few issues
    with Titans: They are generally too expensive for the damage output they bring and in many cases they require
    specialized formations to bring them down, which some armies lack. This leads to situations where the main purpose
    of the Titan is to deny the enemy BTS, TSNP and DTF by rushing onto the opponents table half, contesting one or both
    of the T&H objectives. While in som cases very effective, we thought this was not great from a game design
    perspective.
</p>
<p>
    We have done the following changes to most of the large titans in an attempt to make them a more interesting option.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        We have reduced the price of most titans to make them more viable, given the importance of activations in Epic.
    </li>
    <li>
        We have introduced a general weakness to being swarmed by enemy infantry. To do this we have reduced the close
        combat value of many titans and also changed the stats on most Titan close combat weapons. Titan close combat
        weapons now generally give one extra TK attack doing multiple damage instead of giving multiple extra TK or
        Macro attacks. This reduces their efficiency against infantry while still being useful against other War
        Engines.
    </li>
    <li>
        We have removed Thick Rear Armour from many Titans to force you to play them with a bit more care.
    </li>
    <li>
        We have introduces the "God Machine" and "Split Fire" special rules for large (8+ DC) titans. God machine gives
        blast markers to your opponents army if you kill his Titan, and Split Fire allows you to target more than one
        formation under some circumstances.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When combining these changes we hope to see more Titans fielded, but also to see that people design lists to support
    and protect their Titans in a way that was sometimes not needed in NetEA or Epic UK lists. We also hope this reduces
    the need to bring specialized Titan killer formations to tournaments.
</p>

<h4>Knights</h4>
<p>
    We felt that the War Engine rules did not work well when the War Engines were taken in large formations. They block
    line of sight for each other, both for shooting and fire-fights, and assaults were very challenging if played by the
    book. Each Knight can only allocate close combat hits to enemies in base-to-base and fire-fight hits to enemies not
    in base-to-base. To do this correct you would have to roll for each Knight individually, which is a tedious process.
    In an attempt to fix this we have introduced a new type of unit: Heavy Armoured Vehicle (H-AV). This is used for
    Knights and similar units like e.g. Stompas. Details on the Heavy Armoured Vehicle rules can be found in the army
    lists, but on a high level they behave like an Armoured Vehicle with 2 DC.
