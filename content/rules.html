<h2>Rules</h2>
<p class="lead">
    EA:Ragnarök uses the NetEA rules, which can be found over at the <a
        href="http://www.tp.net-armageddon.org/tournament-pack/" target="_blank" class="external">NetEA Tournament
    Pack</a> site. There are a number of rules in the NetEA Epic Game Rules that can be interpreted in more than one
    way. These are the interpretations, and in some cases house-rules, that we used when developing the EA:Ragnarök
    lists. We suggest you also use these when playing EA:Ragnarök lists and scenarios.
</p>

<h3>EA:Ragnarök rule interpretations & house-rules</h3>
<h6>Say it and its true</h6>
<p>
    Effectively lots of things may move on a table. If a player is able to put a unit 6cm away from another unit, or
    10cm into terrain, then saying they are doing so makes it so. This means if later a piece is budged say to cause
    intermingle, it won't be treated as such. - If you think it can't be done, advise your opponent when they 'say it'.
</p>

<h6>'Scouting from behind'</h6>
<p>
    An issue that is explicitly unresolved in the core rules is the issue of units with the 'Scout' special rule blocking formations from engaging in unfair ways.
    While 'just don't do it' resolves some situations, it does lead to a grey zone of play which is very problematic and leads to unnecessary arguments.
    To resolve this issue we suggest that units with 'Scout' only counts as having 5cm in 'Zone of Control' for entire duration
    of when enemy formations conducts an Engage action. The only restriction is that Engaging formations may only move past, but not between, units with 'Scout'.
</p>

<h6>Preserve allocation order between normal and macro hits</h6>
<p>
    Macro and standard hits are resolved in separate phases of shooting and assaults. We suggest you preserve the
    allocation order between the two phases. I.e. Imperial Guard with a Gorgon assault and receive 2 normal hits and 1
    TK. The Gorgon and guardsmen are equally close to the enemy. If the Imperial Guard player choose to take the normal
    hits into the Gorgon, and it doesnt die, he must also take the TK into the Gorgon. Likewise if he take the regular
    hits into the guardsmen and they dont die the TK goes into the guardsmen. If the Guardsmen die from the normal hits
    the TK goes into the nearest surviving unit to the enemy.
</p>

<h6>Formations mixing BP and standard weapons</h6>
<p>
    As far as we understand there are no rules defining how things work when a formation fires both BP and standard
    weapons. We suggest the following house-rule: A formation can chose to fire it's BP weapons before or after any
    non-BP weapons has been fired. This includes Macro and Titan Killer BP weapons (an exception to the
    macro-always-goes-last rule). Resolve the BP shooting as a separate phase i.e. allocate and resolve hits from the BP weapon
    before moving on to ordinary weapons. Hits from ordinary weapons should be allocated front-to-back, as usual. This
    means that units that were hit by the BP weapon and survived can be allocated a second hit from standard
    shooting.
</p>

<h6>Maximize the effect of special rules when shooting</h6>
<p>
    There are cases where some of the weapons fired has special rules while others don't. It could be Tau Railgun
    Hammerheads (where some of the AT fire has <i>Lance</i>) or a Baneblade where one of the weapons has <i>Ignore
    Cover</i>. Hits are (as always) allocated from the front to the back but if it matters how the hits with special
    rules are allocated, if should be done to favor of the shooting formation. E.g. A Baneblade fires at orks, where
    three orks are in the open while the rest is in a house (4+ cover save). The Baneblade fires all its weapons into
    cover (to be able to hit all the Orks). It scores four AP hits without special rules and one with the <i>ignore
    cover</i> special rule. In this case the <i>ignore cover</i> hit should not be allocated to any of the three Orks
    hit in the open but to one of the two Orks in the house to maximize the effect of <i>ignore cover</i>. Another
    example would be the Hammerheads shooting at a Chaos Armoured Company of two Predators and two Land Raiders. The
    Hammerheads score one standard hit and two with <i>lance</i>. The Predators are in front of the Chaos formation and
    will take the two first hits. The remaining hit, allocated to the Land Raider, should be one of the two hits with
    <i>lance</i>.
</p>

<h6>Disembarking & embarking ground transports</h6>
<p>
    When disembarking from a transport the disembarking unit should be placed within 5cm of the transport. Only a part
    of the model needs to be within 5cm of the transport vehicle, not the whole model. When embarking on a ground
    transport the transport needs to touch the unit it is picking up.
</p>

<h6>Disembarking & embarking air transports</h6>
<p>
    When disembarking from an air transport the disembarking unit should be placed within 5cm (or 15cm if the unit has
    <i>jump packs</i>) of the transport. Only a part of the model needs to be within 5cm (or 15cm) of the transport
    vehicle, not the whole model. When an air transport lands to pick up a formation, all units within (any part of the
    model) 5cm of the transport can be picked up. The air transport can land on (barge) the units it is picking up. This
    way you don't have to prepare a free "landing zone" inside a large formation in order to get all units in the
    formation in range to be picked up. A formation may also move on to a landed air transport, in which case all units
    needs to touch the landed air transport in order to embark (no 5cm "pickup zone" in this case)
</p>

<h6>Broken air transports</h6>
<p>
    In case an air transport breaks (without dying) it can choose to stay on the board and rally like any other
    ground unit or to make a disengagement move. The rules for what happens if it chooses to fly off is a bit
    vague. We suggest the following: As soon as the unit/formation takes of in order to fly out it once again
    counts as an aircraft, with a number of blast markers equal to the number it took to break the unit or
    formation. It can (like any other aircraft) pick up additional blastmarkes on the way out, if shot by enemy
    flak and/or if it exits from any table edge other than its own table edge.
    E.g. an Ork Landa is broken by shooting on the ground and choses to fly off in the end phase. Once airborn
    it will have 3 blast markers (one for each DC). It is also hit by enemy flak (without being wounded) on the
    way out, resulting in 4 BMs when trying to activate in the next turn.
</p>

<h6>Aircraft sniping</h6>
<p>
    The rules does not restrict you from placing ground attacking aircrafts inside a formation or even on top of
    enemy units in order to allocate hits to chosen enemy characters or units. This feels a bit gamy, and we
    suggest the following house-rule: Aircrafts on a ground attack mission may not be placed within 5cm of an
    enemy unit in the formation it is targeting. The restriction is always 5cm even for units with the
    <i>scout</i> special rule.
</p>

<h6>Always roll for critical hits</h6>
<p>
    Players must always roll for critical hits in any situation where the critical hit may affect units or formations around the war engine,
    even if the War Engine was reduced to 0 DC before crits have been rolled for.
</p>

<h6>Blocking Wraithgates and other portals</h6>
<p>
    The rules for portals are not clear about what happens if the enemy blocks it, either by placing units on
    top of it or by placing it in their zone of control. We suggest that you can always enter play via the
    portal, but if it is in enemy zone of control you have to use an assault action to do so. Even if there are
    units physically blocking the portal you can place your units on the board, as close as possible to the
    portal. Normal charge move rules apply, i.e. a charging unit that enters a zone of control must move into
    base contact with the nearest enemy who's zone of control has been entered. Only once all zones of control
    covering the portal has ben neutralized (by placing a unit in base to base) can remaining units in the
    assaulting formation move in any direction they desire. Formations failing an activation roll to engage from
    within a blocked portal may not enter play and must use the hold action to remove blast markers.
</p>

<h6>Moving out of Wraithgates and other portals</h6>
<p>
    Rules for how to enter play from a webway or other portal can be played in different ways. We suggest you start
    measuring the move from within the portal, i.e. the first 4cm of movement is used to get on to the board given a
    standard 4x1 infantry base. This means a formation with 15cm move advancing out of a portal would have to end their
    move with all parts of all units within 15cm of the portal.
</p>

<h6>Terrain height, skimmers & hills</h6>
<p>
    Terrain and War Engines are "infinitely high" to ground units with regards to line of sight. No ground unit can see
    directly through a piece of terrain – unless they are in it. Popped up skimmers can see over terrain, but can only
    see units that are further away from the edge of the terrain piece than they are. Same rule as for popped up
    skimmers also apply for units on hills. Aircrafts can always see over all terrain. In addition, see the 'Terrain' section on this website.
