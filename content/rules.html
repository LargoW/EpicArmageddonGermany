<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>
    EA-Ragnarok uses the NetEA rules, which can be found over at the <a
        href="http://www.tp.net-armageddon.org/tournament-pack/" target="_blank" class="external">NetEa Tournament
    Pack</a> site. We have
    done a few general changes across all Epic Armageddon: Ragnarok lists that we hope will improve the game, and overall list design.
</p>

<h3>Titans</h3>
<p>
    We wanted Titans to be a more common site in Epic. Looking at NetEA and Epic UK we thought there were a few issues
    with Titans: They are generally too expensive for the damage output they bring and in many cases they require
    specialized formations to bring them down, which some armies lack. This leads to situations where the main purpose
    of the Titan is to deny the enemy BTS, TSNP and DTF by rushing onto the opponents table half, contesting one or both
    of the T&H objectives. While in som cases very effective, we thought this was not great from a game design
    perspective.
</p>
<p>
    We have done the following changes to most of the large titans in an attempt to make them a more interesting option.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        We have reduced the price of most titans to make them more viable, given the importance of activations in Epic.
    </li>
    <li>
        We have introduced a general weakness to being swarmed by enemy infantry. To do this we have reduced the close
        combat value of many titans and also changed the stats on the Titan close combat weapons. Titan close combat
        weapons now generally give one extra TK attack doing multiple woulds instead of giving multiple extra TK or
        Macro attacks. This reduces their efficiency against infantry while still being useful against other War
        Engines.
    </li>
    <li>
        We have removed Thick Rear Armour from many Titans to force you to play them with a bit more care.
    </li>
    <li>We have introduces the "God Machine" and "Split Fire" special rules for large (8+ DC) titans. God machine gives
        blast markers to your opponents army if you kill his Titan, and Split Fire allows you to target more than one
        formation under some circumstances.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When combining these changes we hope to see more Titans fielded, but also to see that people design lists to support
    and protect their Titans in a way that was sometimes not needed in NetEA or Epic UK lists. We also hope this reduces
    the need to bring specialized Titan killer formations to tournaments.
</p>

<h3>Knights</h3>
<p>
    We felt that the War Engine rules did not work well when the War Engines were taken in large formations. They block
    line of sight for each other, both for shooting and fire-fights, and assaults were very challenging if played by the
    book. Each Knight can only allocate close combat hits to enemies in base-to-base and fire-fight hits to enemies not
    in base-to-base. To do this correct you would have to roll for each Knight individually, which is a tedious process.
    In an attempt to fix this we have introduced a new type of unit: Heavy Vehicle. This is used for Knights and similar
    units like e.g. Stompas. Details on the Heavy Vehicle rules can be found in the army lists, but on a high level they
    behave like an Armoured Vehicle with 2 DC.
</p>

<h3>Formation upgrades</h3>
<p>
    Many formation upgrades have received a price reduction to compensate for the loss of activations. We felt that many
    upgrades were too pricy and were rarely taken given the importance of activations in Epic.
