<h2>Fire the Beacons</h2>
<p class="lead">
    The Fire the Beacons scenario is based on the scenario described in the
    <a href="https://tp.net-armageddon.org/tournament-pack/#epic-tournament-game-rules">NetEA Epic Tournament Game
        Rules</a>. The scenario description below describes how the Battle Line scenario differs from the NetEA
    original. Any section s not mentioned here, such as Setup, Pre-game discussions, etc, uses the exact rules from the
    NetEA original.
</p>

<h4>Place Objective Markers</h4>
<p>This scenario requires 3 special objective tokens for each player, with a special marker or double sided marker (for
    example a coin) which can be flipped or exchanged as objectives switch control between players.</p>

<p>These objectives are placed in the same manner as in the Epic Tournament Scenario with some additional restrictions.
    In addition to standard objective placement rules the Blitz objective must be placed at least 15cm away from any
    corner, and the remaining two objectives must be set up at least 15cm away from any board edge.</p>

<p>Unlike in the normal Epic Tournament Scenario, objectives do have memory. Each objective starts the game in
    possession of the player who's half it is.</p>

<p>Objectives flips sides when the opposing side is the only one that has an unbroken unit within 15cm of it after each completed action by any formation. This includes units that have successfully rallied. Formations that are restricted to contesting
    objectives may only prevent enemy formations from flipping objectives.</p>

<h4>Victory Conditions</h4>
<p>Same as the NetEA Epic Tournament Game Rules, with the following changes:</p>

<p>
    As usual, units from broken formations or from formations that have rallied that End Phase cannot contest
    objectives, but this also includes the "They Shall Not Pass" victory condition. A formation the rallies within 15cm
    from an unguarded enemy objective will immediately flip the objective, before Victory Conditions are calculated. In
    addition, Aircraft which have landed may neither capture nor contest objectives or deny "They Shall Not Pass" on the
    same turn that it lands.
</p>

<p>In the End Phase of each turn before formations have rallied, count objectives. The "Break their spirit" VC is worth 3 points once. The Blitz objective is worth 2 points each turn. All other objectives are worth 1 point each turn.
    These points accumulate from the first turn onwards.</p>

<p>The game ends after three turns, or if either player manages to accumulate a lead of 8 VP in any turn.</p>
