<h2>Fire the Beacons</h2>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>Same as the normal Epic Tournament Scenario.</p>
<h3>Place Objective Markers</h3>
<p>This scenario requires 3 special objective tokens for each player, with a special marker or double sided marker (for example a coin) which can be flipped or exchanged as objectives switch control between players.</p>
<p>These objectives are placed in the same manner as in the Epic Tournament Scenario, but the Blitz objective must be placed at least 15cm from any corner, and the remaining two objectives must be set up at least 15cm from any board edge.</p>
<p>As usual, units from broken formations or from formations that have rallied that End Phase cannot capture or contest objectives, but this also includes "They Shall Not Pass". In addition, Aircraft which have landed may neither capture nor contest objectives on the same turn that it lands.</p>
<p>Each objective starts the game in possession of the player who's half it is. Unlike in the normal Epic Tournament Scenario, objectives do have memory.</p>
    <p>Objectives flips sides when the opposing side is the only one that has an unbroken unit within 15cm of it at any point of the turn. This includes units that have successfully rallied, and units that have made a complete move as part of an order (for example after the first move in a double). Formations that are restricted to contesting objectives may only prevent enemy formations from flipping objectives.</p>
    <p>In the End Phase each uncontested Victory Condition (Blitz, They Shall Not Pass etc.) is worth 1 VP. These VPs accumulate from the first turn onwards.</p>
    <p>The game ends after three turns, or if either player manages to accumulate a lead of 8 VP in the second turn.</p>
