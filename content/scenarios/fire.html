<h2>Fire the Beacons</h2>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>Same as the normal Epic Tournament Scenario.</p>
<h3>Place Objective Markers</h3>
<p>This scenario requires 3 special objective tokens for each player, with a special marker or double sided marker (for example a coin) which can be flipped or exchanged as objectives switch control between players.</p>
<p>These objectives are placed in the same manner as in the Epic Tournament Scenario, but the Blitz objective must be placed at least 15cm from any corner, and the remaining two objectives must be set up at least 15cm from any board edge.</p>
<p>As usual, units from broken formations or from formations that have rallied that End Phase cannot capture or contest objectives, but this also includes "They Shall Not Pass". In addition, Aircraft which have landed may neither capture nor contest objectives on the same turn that it lands.</p>
<p>Each objective starts the game in possession of the player who's half it is. Unlike in the normal Epic Tournament Scenario, objectives do have memory.</p>
    <p>Objectives flips sides when the opposing side is the only one that has an unbroken unit within 15cm of it at any point of the turn. This includes units that have successfully rallied, and units that have made a complete move as part of an order (for example after the first move in a double). Formations that are restricted to contesting objectives may only prevent enemy formations from flipping objectives.</p>
    <p>Each objective is worth 1 VP in the End Phase, except for the objective in the enemy deployment zone (the "Blitz" objective), which is worth 1 VP for the friendly player, and 2 VP for the enemy player. Destroying the most valuable enemy formation (the "BTS" formation) is worth a one-time bonus of 3 VP. VPs accumulate from turn to turn, starting in the End Phase of the first turn just before rallying.</p>

<h3>Battle Tiebreak</h3>
<p>Same as the normal Epic Tournament Scenario.</p>
<h3>Special Rules</h3>
<p>If a player gives up the game, or does not show up within 30 minutes it is scored as a Total Victory for the
    opponent. If a game must be abandoned before turn 4 because of lack of time, the current objective total determines
    the score, with a -4 penalty for both sides if the game ended prematurely in turn 2, and a -2 penalty for both sides
    if the game ended prematurely in turn 3. If one player was late to the game start by more than 5 minutes, that
    player takes both playerâ€™s penalties.</p>
