<h2>Battle Line</h2>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>Same as the normal Epic Tournament Scenario.</p>
<h3>Place Objective Markers</h3>
<p>Same as in the Epic Tournament Scenario, but the Blitz objective must be placed at least 15cm from any corner, and the remaining two
    objectives must be set up at least 15cm from any board edge.</p>
<p>As usual, units from broken formations or from formations that have rallied that End Phase cannot capture or contest objectives, but this also includes "They Shall Not Pass". In addition, Aircraft which have landed may neither capture nor contest objectives on the same turn that it lands.</p>
<h3>Setup Spacecraft & Garrisons</h3>
<p>Same as the normal Epic Tournament Scenario.</p>
<h3>Set-up Remaining Formations</h3>
<p>Same as the normal Epic Tournament Scenario.</p>
<h3>Victory Conditions</h3>
<p>If at the end of any turn a player has achieved 4 or more Victory Conditions than the opponent then the game ends,
    compare victory conditions and work out tournament/battle points.</p>
<p>You must check to see if either player has won at the end of the third and fourth game turns. If neither player has
    won at the end of the fourth turn then the ‘tiebreaker’ rule is used to determine the winner.</p>
<p> Otherwise it is the same as the normal Epic Tournament Scenario.</p>
