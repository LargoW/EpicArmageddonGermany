<h2>Battle Line</h2>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>Same as the normal Epic Tournament Scenario.</p>
<h3>Place Objective Markers</h3>
<p>Same as in the Epic Tournament Scenario, but the Blitz objective must be placed at least 15cm from any corner, and the remaining two
    objectives must be set up at least 15cm from any board edge.</p>
<p>As usual, units from broken formations or from formations that have rallied that End Phase cannot capture or contest objectives, but this also includes "They Shall Not Pass". In addition, Aircraft which have landed may neither capture nor contest objectives on the same turn that it lands.</p>
<h3>Setup Spacecraft & Garrisons</h3>
<p>Same as the normal Epic Tournament Scenario.</p>
<h3>Set-up Remaining Formations</h3>
<p>Same as the normal Epic Tournament Scenario.</p>
<h3>Victory Conditions</h3>
<p>If at the end of any turn a player has achieved 4 or more Victory Conditions than the opponent then the game ends,
    compare victory conditions and work out tournament/battle points.</p>
<p>You must check to see if either player has won at the end of the third and fourth game turns. If neither player has
    won at the end of the fourth turn then the ‘tiebreaker’ rule is used to determine the winner.</p>
<p> Otherwise it is the same as the normal Epic Tournament Scenario.</p>

    <li>Victory (Difference of 2 objectives) 28-4 in turn 3, 26-6 in turn 4.</li>
    <li>Minor Victory (Difference of 1 objective) 26-6 in turn 3, 24-8 in turn 4.</li>
    <li>Winning Draw (Tiebreak difference of more than 750 BP). 20-12.</li>
    <li>Minor Winning Draw (Tiebreak difference of more than 250 BP). 18-14.</li>
    <li>Complete Draw (Tiebreak difference equal to or less than 250 BP) 16-16.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Battle Tiebreak</h3>
<p>Same as the normal Epic Tournament Scenario.</p>

<h3>Special Rules</h3>
<p>If a player gives up the game, or does not show up within 30 minutes it is scored as a Total Victory for the
    opponent. If a game must be abandoned before turn 4 because of lack of time, the current objective total determines
    the score, with a -4 penalty for both sides if the game ended prematurely in turn 2, and a -2 penalty for both sides
    if the game ended prematurely in turn 3. If one player was late to the game start by more than 5 minutes, that
    player takes both player’s penalties.</p>
