<h2>Online Gaming</h2>
<p>
    There are two main options for playing Epic Armageddon online, Tabletop Simulator (which is 3d) and Vassal (which is
    2d). Each has their advantages, but the former was used in the development of Epic Armageddon Ragnarök, and benefits
    from the dedicated modules below that have been developed and are being maintained by the community. That being
    said, if someone wishes to create dedicated modules and instructions for playing Epic Armageddon Ragnarök on Vassal,
    we would happily add them to this page.

<h4>Tabletop Simulator</h4>

<p>The modules in the collection below contain everything you need to play all 'Approved' Epic Armageddon Ragnarök
    armies on Tabletop Simulator. If there are any issues with any of them, please alert us in the Epic Ragnarök
