<h2>Terrain</h2>

<p class="lead">
    In Epic Armageddon, certain types of terrain have become much more common than others, simply because some terrain
    types tend to favor certain types of armies over others. For this reason we have created a revised Terrain Effects
    table where we also introduced a few new terrain effects. We hope this will contribute to more varied game tables
    while keeping the balance of the armies intact.
</p>

<h4>True line of sight vs. infinite height</h4>

<p>
    Epic Armageddon rules as written assumes you play with "true line of sight", meaning if the Warlord model is taller
    than the wood, you can see it from the other side. The leads to various odd scenarios (such as people modelling
    their Warhounds kneeling, to be able to hide behind low terrain) and discussions. We strongly recommend you play
    all terrain as "infinitely high". This also includes War Engines, as they also block Line of Sight.
</p>
<p>
    No ground unit can see directly through a piece of terrain â€“ unless they are in it. Popped up skimmers can see over
    terrain, but can only see units that are further away from the edge of the terrain piece than they are. Same rule
    as for popped up skimmers also apply for units on hills. Aircrafts can always see over all terrain.
</p>

<p>
    <i>God Machines</i>: Units with the <i>God Machine</i> special rule are so tall that they are considered to be
    always 'popped up' for Line of Sight purposes. As with other popped up units, they may never claim cover to hit
    modifiers from intervening terrain, even while inside terrain. God Machines counts as being taller than all terrain
    pieces, and will block line of sight even to units that are popped up or on a hill (including other God Machines on
    hills).
</p>

<h4>Terrain Effects</h4>
<p>
    We have revised a few of the terrain effects from the NetEA rules. Terrain effects not mentioned here are identical
    to the NetEA rules.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Difficult terrain</b>:
    In addition to the standard Dangerous terrain we have introduced Difficult terrain.

    Roll a D6 when you enter difficult terrain, or when you start to move if already in difficult terrain. On a roll of
    1 you roll a second die. On a roll of 1-3 on the second die, the unit is destroyed with no save allowed, but the
    formation it is part of does not receive a Blast marker.

    Units may choose to move through difficult terrain cautiously. A unit that is moving cautiously counts as having a
    speed of 5cm, but does not have to roll any Difficult Terrain test. Units with the <i>Walker</i> special rule can
    also move threw Difficult terrain without having to roll Difficult terrain tests.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Open Ground</b>:
    In the NetEa rules it is mentioned as a terrain effect on open ground that Infantry count as being in cover (-1 to
    hit modifier) and receive a 5+ cover save if they are on <i>Overwatch</i> in Open Ground. We suggest you extend
    this rule to all terrain types. I.e. an Infantry unit on <i>Overwatch</i> in Scrubs (6+ cover save) would still
    get 5+ cover save from being on <i>Overwatch</i>.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Hills</b>: As previously mentioned, units on a hill counts as popped up skimmers for the purpose of Line of
    Sight. See the top section of this page. Hills may optionally have one or more steep hillsides, which is
    impassable to all unit types (make sure to cover this during the five minute warm up).
</p>

<p>
    <b>Roads</b>: Units that spend a whole move on a road may add 5cms to their move (does not apply to non-standard
    movement such as counter charges or consolidation movement). In addition, if all of the units in a formation are on
    a road at the start of their action, you may declare they will make a road move. The formation may attempt to do
    an Advance, Double or March action, gaining an additional +1 to the activation roll. However, all of the units in
    the formation must remain on the road during the entire action.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Armoured Vehicles</b>:
    Infantry units counts as being in cover and receive the -1 to hit modifier (but no cover save) if they are touching
    <b>a friendly</b> Armoured Vehicle or War Engine, to represent their ability to take cover from enemy fire by
    crouching behind the vehicle. There can be no more than two units for each Armoured Vehicle, four for each H-AV, or
    two for each DC that a War Engine has.
</p>

<!--
<p><i>Hull Down</i>: All terrain that blocks Line of Sight can give Hull Down to units that are inside such terrain, or
    even partially obscured behind it to all units in the firing formation.</p>

<p><i>Dangerous Terrain</i>: Roll a D6 when you enter dangerous terrain, or when you start to move if already in
    dangerous terrain. On a roll of 1, the unit is destroyed with no save allowed, but the formation it is part of does
    not receive a Blast marker. Units may choose to move through dangerous terrain cautiously. A unit that is moving
    cautiously counts as having a speed of 5cm, but is allowed to re-roll any Dangerous Terrain tests that it fails.
</p>

<p><i>Difficult Terrain</i>: As Dangerous Terrain, but units take damage on a 7+ instead of a 6+. Units that has the
    'Walker' special rule, or that moves cautiously, completely ignores Difficult Terrain.</p>

<p><i>Objectives and Impassable Terrain</i>: Objectives may not be placed inside of terrain that is Impassible for any
    unit type.</p>

<p><i>Skimmers, Support Craft and Impassable Terrain</i>: Skimmers and Support Craft can move over Impassable Terrain,
    but cannot stop there, not even if the terrain type does not block Line of Sight.</p>
